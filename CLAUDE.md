## 🚀 Future Development Plans

### 📅 Next Session Goals

#### 🎨 AI Art Gallery Implementation
**High Priority - Ready to Build:**
- **Custom image loading system** using Three.js TextureLoader
- **AI-generated artwork** from DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion
- **Picture frames** with different styles (modern, classic, ornate)
- **Gallery lighting** with spotlights highlighting each piece
- **Interactive plaques** showing artwork info/prompts when approached
- **Rotating exhibitions** - artworks change periodically

**Technical Approach:**
```javascript
// Custom image loading for AI art
const loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
loader.load('path/to/ai-art.jpg', (texture) => {
    const artMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ map: texture });
    // Create framed artwork
});
```

#### 🏢 Office Expansion Ideas
**Medium Priority:**
- **Lounge Area:** Comfortable seating with couches and coffee tables
- **Meeting Rooms:** Conference tables with presentation screens
- **Kitchen/Break Room:** Enhanced coffee station, fridges, microwaves
- **Library Corner:** Bookshelves with technical books and reading area
- **Gaming Zone:** Arcade machines or console setup for breaks

#### 🎮 Interactive Features
**Medium-High Priority:**
- **Clickable objects:** Interactive computers, coffee machines, whiteboards
- **Working elevator/doors** with smooth animations
- **Aquarium or fish tank** with swimming fish animations
- **Window views** showing cityscape or nature scenes
- **Weather system** affecting lighting and ambiance

#### 🤖 Character & AI Improvements
**Low-Medium Priority:**
- **More diverse characters** with different roles and personalities
- **Advanced AI conversations** using OpenAI API for dynamic responses
- **Character backstories** and personality-driven interactions
- **Meeting simulations** where characters interact with each other
- **Skill demonstrations** - characters showing their work

### 📊 Content Management
**Future Considerations:**
- **CMS Integration:** Easy way to update office content without code changes
- **Admin Panel:** Control lighting, characters, decorations remotely
- **Analytics:** Track visitor interactions and popular areas
- **Multi-tenant:** Different office themes for different companies

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Commands Reference
```bash
# Development Workflow
git checkout -b feature/new-feature    # Create feature branch
git add . && git commit -m "message"   # Commit changes
git push origin feature/new-feature    # Push for preview deployment

# Merge to Production
git checkout master                    # Switch to master
git merge feature/new-feature          # Merge changes
git push origin master                 # Deploy to production
vercel --prod                         # Force production deployment

# Quick Tools
vercel ls                             # List deployments
vercel logs [url]                     # Check deployment logs
gh repo view --web                    # Open GitHub repo
```
